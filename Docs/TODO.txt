----------------
Short term
---------------
Fix viewmatrix. Currently rotate and translate is backwards (translate -> rotate), meaning camera always orbits zero.
    Create a camera object. Has pos, rotation and a getViewMatrix accessor, which creates a mat like this: new mat -> identity ->  rotate(rotation) - > translate(pos)


-----------
Long term
---------
Add parent translation, rotation, scaling to model matrix retrieval before drawing.
Add game selection,
Separate game includes from engine includes & automate game include loading

Camera controls
Make a math library
Incorporate a physics engine
Add normal to vertex attributes
Add additional sets of uv attributes, incase custom vertex data is required.

Fix ECM linking: move ECM includes to iframe, load iframe from main.html

move all include groupings into appropriately named iframe includes

Default uniforms like _Time, _MVP, _Model, _VP

Refactor JS code into proper objects.
    Engine.js
    Graphics.js
    GraphicsLib.js
    Mathf.js

Create VBOs for basic shapes: quad, cube, sphere, pyramid, etc.

Create a mesh object: 
    has a draw function to set up opengl blend states, draw mode etc. 
    Has a reference to a vbo,
    Has a reference to the shader to use (Separating shader from draw funct will allow shader changes at runtime).
    Has a reference to the texture to use.
    How should it handle uniforms?

Look into 2d and 3d physics solutions.
    Does WebGL's current standard support compute shaders?
    Are there JS physics libraries? Are they used in any commercial projects?
