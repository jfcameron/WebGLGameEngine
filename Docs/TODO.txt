----------------
Short term
---------------
Decouple primary camera from Graphics.js
    Add activeCamera reference in graphics,
    Write camera component: sets up viewport info, view, perspective mats.

Add parent translation, rotation, scaling to model matrix retrieval before drawing.

Fix rigidbody->mesh rotation data

Add ambient light, 

add point lights
    Check frag instruction limit for webgl standards.
    Write point light component, manages point light uniform blocks.

add shadowmaps

add post processing effects

Opaque.glsl: Move light pos to uniform

-----------
Long term
---------
Lighting system

Add additional sets of uv attributes, incase custom vertex data is required.

Default uniforms like _Time, _MVP, _Model, _VP

Create VBOs for basic shapes: circle, sphere, pyramid.

---------
DONE
---------
Incorporate a physics engine
Camera controls in demo scene
Added normal to vertex attributes
Fixed viewmatrix. Currently rotate and translate is backwards (translate -> rotate), meaning camera always orbits zero.
Decoupled demo scene from Game.js.
Wrote "opaque" shader
hardcoded 1 camera translation
hardcoded 1 camera perspective
viewport view
model scale
model rotation
model translation
VBO for cube
programmable draw call for gameobjects
shaderprogram collection
texture collection
lambda find for arrays
Vertex data for Tri
Vertex data for Quad
Library definitions for x,y,z rotations
Fix GLSL function library not loading issue
Add model matrix
Add orthographic projection matrix
Render textured quad
Render NVPC triangle
